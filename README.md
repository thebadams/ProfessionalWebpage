# Professional Portfolio of Brian P. Adams

## Description

This is the web application for my professional portfolio. It is a work in progress on several fronts:
    
    1. It is an ongoing record of my work. Any projects that I have completed will go here, in the portfolio section of the wep application. Currently there are two placeholder cards, held in reserve of as-yet-completed projects.
    
    2. The layout and technologies used within the web application will continue to evolve as my own skills do.

## Instructions

The behavior of the web application should be as follows:

    1. When hovering over any of the text-links in the navigation bar or in the contact-links, the link should be highlighted using a different background, adding a border, and changing the color.

    2. When hovering over the non-focus portfolio cards, the  be highlighted.

    3. When resizing the screen's width, the cards rearrange and cover different widths at the following breakpoints: 992px, and 768px in screen width.

    4. The content of the page is limited in size to 1200px width. Any smaller and the elements will shrink to adjust using flex properties.

    5. The links to outside webpages, when followed, will open a new tab.

## Screenshots

Here are screenshots of the web application at full width, 992px, and 769px:
